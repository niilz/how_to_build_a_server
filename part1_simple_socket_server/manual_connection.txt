In the Tutorial the browser gets simulatet with
another shell using telnet.

#####Code######
$ telnet localhost 8888
Trying 127.0.0.1 â€¦
Connected to localhost.
GET /hello HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Hello, World!
############

Newer MacOS systems don't have telnet.
Instead install netcat.
(check if already installed by typing "which nc")

and type:

#####code#####
nc localhost 8888
GET /hello HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Hello, World!
